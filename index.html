        <View style={{flexDirection:'row'}}> <Text style={{flex: 1, flexWrap: 'wrap'}}> This is the first full week that many working people across Chichester will benefit from the Government’s new tax cut which reduces National Insurance contributions – a welcome boost for thousands in our constituency and millions across the country.<p></p>The cut, from twelve to ten per cent, will put hundreds of pounds in the pockets of workers. For example, a typical self-employed plumber on £34,400 will receive an annual gain of £410, while the average teacher on £44,300 will receive an annual gain of over £630. I know this tax cut will be welcome and should be taken as a clear sign that our post-pandemic recovery plan is working. The Government has consistently stated that over time we will cut taxes in a responsible way, and last week was the start of our delivery on that promise. </View> </p>

        </div> It’s also been a big week at the Department for Education as we launched our campaign to improve school attendance. Last year we made good progress, with 380,000 fewer children persistently absent or not attending school. To ensure we keep up momentum I’m expanding attendance hubs, widening our bespoke attendance mentoring programme and introducing new legislation later this year to modernise and improve how schools record and share data on attendance.<div></div>All the evidence shows that the more time that children spend in the classroom, the better for their resilience, wellbeing, social skills, educational outcomes and life chances. Learning is, of course, a life-long process. I passionately believe no matter where you are from or what stage of life you’re at, you should always be able to get a high-quality education. As part of our new skills offer, where we have worked with over 5,000 businesses to revolutionise technical education, I want to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to learn and upskill throughout life. We’re particularly lucky in Chichester to have a fantastic college who can support you to find the right skills bootcamp, apprenticeship or Higher Technical Qualification for you.. </p>

        <p>Of course, these are just the formal ways you can learn something new. Locally we have so many passionate educators and volunteers who are there to support you. UKHarvest, a wonderful local food rescue charity, are running free online cookery classes starting next Friday, whilst volunteers at the Selsey RNLI train regularly in a huge number of transferable skills. All this and more is available right on our doorsteps in Chichester.
